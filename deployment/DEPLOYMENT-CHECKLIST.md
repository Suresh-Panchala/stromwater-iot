## Troubleshooting Reference

### Backend won't start
```bash
pm2 logs stromwater-backend
# Check database connection in .env
# Check if port 5000 is available
```

### Frontend shows blank page
```bash
# Check API URL in frontend/.env
# Rebuild: cd frontend && npm run build
# Check browser console for errors
```

### Can't connect via domain
```bash
# Check DNS: dig your-domain.com
# Check Nginx: sudo nginx -t
# Check firewall: sudo ufw status
```

### MQTT not connecting
```bash
# Check Mosquitto: sudo systemctl status mosquitto
# Test locally: mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test -u stromwater -P password
```

### Database connection failed
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL: sudo systemctl status postgresql
# Verify credentials in backend/.env
# Check user permissions
```
