   mosquitto_passwd -c passwd stromwater_mqtt
   ```

4. When prompted:
   - Password: `mqtt123`
   - Re-enter: `mqtt123`

5. Verify file created:
   ```cmd
   dir passwd
   ```

   listener 1883
   allow_anonymous false
   password_file "C:\Program Files\mosquitto\passwd"
   log_dest file "C:\Program Files\mosquitto\mosquitto.log"
   ```

5. **Save and close** (File ‚Üí Save)

### Restart Mosquitto Service

1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**

2. Stop the service:
   ```cmd
   net stop mosquitto
   ```
   (Should see: "The Mosquitto Broker service was stopped successfully.")

3. Start the service:
   ```cmd
   net start mosquitto
   ```
   (Should see: "The Mosquitto Broker service was started successfully.")

### Test Mosquitto

1. Open **Command Prompt** (normal, not admin)

2. Navigate to Mosquitto:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files\mosquitto"
   ```

3. **Subscribe to test topic:**
   ```cmd
   mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test -u stromwater_mqtt -P mqtt123
   ```

   - No errors = Success!
   - Window will wait for messages
   - Don't close this window yet

4. Open **another Command Prompt** window

5. Navigate to Mosquitto:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files\mosquitto"
   ```

6. **Publish test message:**
   ```cmd
   mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test -m "Hello StromWater!" -u stromwater_mqtt -P mqtt123
   ```

7. **Go back to first window** - you should see:
   ```
   Hello StromWater!
   ```

8. Press `Ctrl+C` in both windows to stop

‚úÖ **If you saw the message, Mosquitto is working perfectly!**
