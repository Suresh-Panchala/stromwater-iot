- [ ] Verify DB_PASSWORD in backend/.env
- [ ] Try: `psql -h localhost -U stromwater_user -d stromwater_db`

**"MQTT connection error"**
- [ ] Check Mosquitto is running (Services)
- [ ] Verify mosquitto.conf edited correctly
- [ ] Try: `mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test -u stromwater_mqtt -P mqtt123`

**"Port 5000 already in use"**
- [ ] Find process: `netstat -ano | findstr :5000`
- [ ] Kill it: `taskkill /PID <number> /F`

### Frontend won't start

**"Port 3000 already in use"**
- [ ] Find process: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
- [ ] Kill it: `taskkill /PID <number> /F`

**"Cannot connect to backend"**
- [ ] Check backend is running
- [ ] Verify backend shows "Server running..."
- [ ] Check VITE_API_URL in frontend/.env

### Dashboard issues

**"Login fails"**
- [ ] Check backend is running
- [ ] Verify database initialized (should have admin user)
- [ ] Try reinitializing: `cd backend && npm run init-db`

**"No data showing"**
